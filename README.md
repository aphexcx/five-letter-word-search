# five-letter-word-search

##### Featuring a functional, immutable implementation of A* Graph Search

Given two five letter words, A and B, and a dictionary of five letter words, find the shortest transformation from A to B, such that only one letter can be changed at a time and all intermediate words in the transformation must exist in the dictionary.

For example, if A and B are `smart` and `brain`, the result may be:
```
smart
start
stark
stack
slack
black
blank
bland
brand
braid
brain
```
